# docx2hub
Converts Microsoft docx to flat hub XML

Please note that this is just a library and not a standalone converter. For further information and an example implementation see the [frontend project](https://github.com/transpect/docx2hub-frontend). Another usage example is [docx2tex](https://github.com/transpect/docx2tex).

The options for `docx2hub.xpl` are documented in the [file itself](https://github.com/transpect/docx2hub/blob/master/xpl/docx2hub.xpl#L97).

If you want to include this library in your XProc pipeline, please refer to this [tutorial](https://transpect.github.io/getting-started.html).
